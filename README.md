## Welcome to Global Hackathons! 

This group is of, by, and for the amazing, still growing, community of hackers interested in hackathons across the world. 

Global Hackathons is a community. Whenever you post or reply, there are other people sitting behind the screen reading what you say. These other people have thoughts, ideas, dreams, aspirations, troubles, advice, perspectives, feelings, and experiences, just like you. You'll probably end up meeting a lot of them if you go to hackathons. Everyone in this group is a potential new friend—treat them that way.

This document aims to make this group a place for everyone to feel welcome. The rules, guidelines, and code of conduct that follow apply to all HH subgroups, although subgroups may also extend these to better serve their own community.

## Rules and Guidelines
Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in HH. If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a pull request to start the discussion.

Our guiding principle can be summarized in one 90's-era sentence: "Be excellent to each other."

## Da Rules
These are the rules/the things this space is not for. We tried to keep them short, with more indepth explanations in the appendix. Breaking any of these will result in your prompt removal from HH.

No harassment, including personal attacks.
No spam. If Gmail wouldn't put it in my inbox, it shouldn't be in HH. This includes doing attention-catching things like writing in all caps, using linkbait headlines, or otherwise editing the post or preview to pop out at the cost of other posts. Posts not relating to hackathons or tech will also be considered spam.
No shitposting, bad programmer jokes, or memes. Consider posting in a HH Sensible Chuckle.
No recruiting for your startup, company, job, or organization. Consider posting in HH Job Listings instead.
No posting requests or giveaways for free stuff/invites. Those belong in HH Free Stuff.
No illegal/pirated content, requests for it, or information regarding the distribution of it.
No telling people they or their post is not welcome in Hackathon Hackers. If you think a post does not belong in HH, report the post or message an admin. If you make other people feel unwelcome in HH, we will remove you from the group.

## Inclusivity Statement
Global Hackathons is the all-inclusive hackathons community.

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities. There is no one true hacker.

Our community prioritizes marginalized people's safe existence in the community. We will not tolerate posts encouraging:

Insensitivity toward boundary statements, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
Racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviors or assumptions (although these discussions may be moved to HH Constructive Debates if they better fit its guidelines)
However, if you have a post that falls in the above categories yet you feel still belongs in HH, you can message a moderator to discuss it. We've had posts like these in the past that turned into constructive discussions with a bit of reframing. Talking about hard problems is, itself, hard.

## [serious] tag
To encourage a more serious discussion on your post, you may preface it with a [serious] tag. Posts with the serious tag as well as their comments

Must be on topic
Must NOT give intentionally misleading advice
Must NOT be images/memes unless relevant or asked for in the original post
Must NOT be single words or phrases without explanation.
Incident Reporting
If you have an issue with a member or moderator please take it up with the moderators privately via Facebook message to avoid people ganging up or taking sides in an argument in which they are not directly involved. It’s best to contact the moderators on Facebook via private group message so we can discuss the issue with you. We promise that everything will be confidential and we won’t get mad at you if you have a complaint.

We also have a confidential form if you would rather your incident not be tied to your identity.

## About Global Hackathons
Hackathon Hackers is a space where people learn together.

Members are aged from middle school to retirement, span across gender identities and races, and hail from six of the seven continents. They’re united by the common love of creating amazing things with technology, usually over the course of a weekend at some college's hackathon. If this sounds like you, come join us!

## Community Structure
Hackathon Hackers is composed of a loosely-connected ecosystem of Facebook Groups. The main group of Hackathon Hackers is the largest and most active. It's a catch-all for discussions about anything hackers care about. Think of it more as 'HH General' or #general on Slack.

There are over 50 topic-based subgroups of Hackathon Hackers. Each is managed by an independent team of volunteer moderators and must abide by this code of conduct. You can recognize them by the HH prefix in the group's name. Can't find the subgroup you're looking for or don't like what you find? Start your own subgroup today!
